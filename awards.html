			<h4>MEET OUR DESIGNER & SEASON SEVEN'S FACEOFF CHAMPION</h4>
			<p>An award winning cake decorator, Dina Cimarusti finally wants to be able to sculpt faces instead of cakes for a living. As a kid, her artistic talent was discovered by her parents, and they put her in every art class her school had to offer. Being an established cake decorator, she is attentive to detail and experienced in high-pressure environments having worked in busy kitchens her whole life. She was a makeup student of season four Face Off champion Anthony Kosar, who advised her to apply to season seven of Face Off. Dina loves to blend the characteristics of people and animals when creating creatures.</p>
